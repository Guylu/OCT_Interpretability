# OCT_Interpretability
Project for Weizmann institute course: Deep Learning For Computer Vision.
Project by Guy Lutsker, Hagai Ravid.

Using OCT dataset provided by Kermany, we investigate differant deep learning methods (mostly transformers) and their application in medical imaging.
We fit several architectures on the data in a supervised fashion, and interpret the models using Grad-CAM, Occlusion tests, and review the attention maps.

In addition we look into the self supervised model called DINO (by FAIR), and investigate the usages of self supervised models in medical imaging ( transfer learning from ImageNet to Kermany dataset)
